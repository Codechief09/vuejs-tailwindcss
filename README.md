## Notes

-   The dark mode is highly inspired by [Gridsome Portfolio Starter by Andre Madarang](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter). Since that project is based on Gridsome, I wanted to create a Vue.js and TailwindCSS portfolio with dark mode
-   Coming Soon [I'll be doing a screencast](https://www.youtube.com/c/StomanStudio). Soon I'll be uploading a video to my YouTube channel where I'll be going through the process of creating this portoflio
